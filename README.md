This is an overview of the top Python HTTP clients, their features, and best use cases for web scraping in 2025:

- [Requests](#requests)
- [urllib3](#urllib3)
- [Uplink](#uplink)
- [GRequests](#grequests)
- [HTTPX](#httpx)
- [aiohttp](#aiohttp)

## Requests

Requests stands as the most widely used Python HTTP client, boasting an impressive 30 million weekly downloads.

Here's an example of how you can handle HTTP requests and responses with Requests, using `httpbin.org` that provides sample responses for testing various HTTP methods:

```python
import requests

print("Testing `requests` library...")
resp = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/get', params={"foo": "bar"})
if resp.status_code == 200:     # success
    print(f"Response Text: {resp.text} (HTTP-{resp.status_code})")
else:   # error
    print(f"Error: HTTP-{resp.status_code}")
```

With the `requests.get(...)` method, you can easily pass URL parameters using the `params` argument without manually adding query strings.

Requests automatically handles query string encoding, JSON data processing, and HTTP redirects. It also provides built-in SSL support. Under the hood, it leverages urllib3 for low-level HTTP operations while offering a more intuitive interface.

Session management is another powerful feature, allowing you to maintain cookies, headers, and authentication across multiple requestsâ€”essential for accessing protected content during web scraping.

For handling large responses efficiently, Requests offers streaming capabilities:

```python
import requests

print("Testing `requests` library with streaming...")
resp = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/stream/10', stream=True)
for chunk in resp.iter_content(chunk_size=1024):
    print(chunk.decode('utf-8'))
```

Requests does have some limitations: it lacks native asynchronous capabilities and HTTP/2 support, with no plans to add the latter according to [this discussion](https://github.com/psf/requests/issues/5757#issuecomment-782695134). While it doesn't include built-in caching, you can use extensions like `requests-cache`.

> **Note:** HTTP/2 improves upon HTTP/1.1 with features like multiplexing, which allows multiple requests over a single TCP connection for faster page loads.

Requests remains popular due to its straightforward syntax, automatic connection pooling, JSON handling, and comprehensive [documentation](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## urllib3

[urllib3](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3) serves as a robust foundation for HTTP requests, powering many other HTTP clients while offering direct access to low-level HTTP functionality.

Here's a basic example using urllib3:

```python
import urllib3

print("Testing `urllib3` library...")
http = urllib3.PoolManager()    # PoolManager for connection pooling
resp = http.request('GET', 'https://httpbin.org/get', fields={"foo": "bar"})

if resp.status == 200:     # success
    print(f"Response: {resp.data.decode('utf-8')} (HTTP-{resp.status})")
else:    # error
    print(f"Error: HTTP-{resp.status}")
```

The `urllib3.PoolManager()` creates reusable connection pools that enhance performance by eliminating the overhead of establishing new connections for each request.

urllib3 excels at handling streaming responses, making it ideal for processing large datasets without memory overload. It also supports automatic redirects and SSL connections.

However, urllib3 lacks built-in asynchronous capabilities, caching, session management, and HTTP/2 support.

While urllib3's connection pooling implementation is more complex than Requests, it maintains a straightforward scripting syntax and provides well-maintained [documentation](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Consider urllib3 for basic web scraping tasks where you need power without session management.

## Uplink

[Uplink](https://github.com/prkumar/uplink) offers a distinctive approach to HTTP requests through class-based interfaces, particularly useful for API-focused web scraping.

Here's how you can use Uplink to interact with an API:

```python
import uplink

@uplink.json
class JSONPlaceholderAPI(uplink.Consumer):
    @uplink.get("/posts/{post_id}")
    def get_post(self, post_id):
        pass


def demo_uplink():
    print("Testing `uplink` library...")
    api = JSONPlaceholderAPI(base_url="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com")
    resp = api.get_post(post_id=1)
    if resp.status_code == 200:     # success
        print(f"Response: {resp.json()} (HTTP-{resp.status_code})")
    else:   # error
        print(f"Error:HTTP-{resp.status_code}")
```

This example defines a `JSONPlaceholderAPI` class that inherits from `uplink.Consumer`. The `@uplink.get` decorator creates an HTTP GET request with a dynamic `post_id` parameter in the endpoint path.

Uplink handles SSL connections and automatic redirects. It also supports the unique [Bring Your Own HTTP Library](https://uplink.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#features) feature.

The library lacks built-in support for streaming responses, asynchronous requests, caching (though it can use `requests-cache`), and HTTP/2.

While Uplink provides good [documentation](https://uplink.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), it's not actively maintained (last release was 0.9.7 in March 2022). Its class-based approach appeals to object-oriented developers but may feel less intuitive for those preferring Python's scripting style.

Choose Uplink when your scraping focuses primarily on RESTful API endpoints rather than HTML pages.

## GRequests

[GRequests](https://github.com/spyoungtech/grequests) extends the popular Requests library with asynchronous capabilities, allowing simultaneous data fetching from multiple sources.

Here's an example demonstrating GRequests in action:

```python
import grequests

print("Testing `grequests` library...")
# Fetching data from multiple URLs
urls = [
    'https://www.python.org/',
    'http://httpbin.org/get',
    'http://httpbin.org/ip',
]

responses = grequests.map((grequests.get(url) for url in urls))
for resp in responses:
    print(f"Response for: {resp.url} ==> HTTP-{resp.status_code}")
```

This code sends three concurrent GET requests using `grequests.map(...)` and collects the responses. GRequests leverages [gevent](https://www.gevent.org/) to handle asynchronous operations without requiring complex concurrency management.

GRequests supports automatic redirects, SSL connections, and streaming responses. It lacks built-in HTTP/2 support and caching (though it can use `requests-cache`).

The library simplifies asynchronous requests with an intuitive API similar to Requests, eliminating the need for complex async/await patterns. However, its [documentation](https://github.com/spyoungtech/grequests) is minimal due to its small codebase (213 lines in version 0.7.0) and limited development activity.

Consider GRequests when you need to gather data from multiple sources simultaneously with minimal complexity.

## HTTPX

[HTTPX](https://www.python-httpx.org/quickstart/) represents a modern evolution of Python HTTP clients, designed as a Requests replacement with added asynchronous support and improved performance.

Here's an example of HTTPX's asynchronous capabilities:

```python
import httpx
import asyncio

async def fetch_posts():
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
        return response.json()

async def httpx_demo():
    print("Testing `httpx` library...")
    posts = await fetch_posts()
    for idx, post in enumerate(posts):
        print(f"Post #{idx+1}: {post['title']}")

# async entry point to execute the code
asyncio.run(httpx_demo())
```

This code defines an asynchronous function `fetch_posts()` that retrieves data from an API using `httpx.AsyncClient()`. The `httpx_demo()` function awaits the results and processes them.

HTTPX stands out with its built-in HTTP/2 support, enabling faster loading of multiple resources over a single connection and making browser fingerprinting more difficult during web scraping.

To use HTTP/2 with HTTPX:

```python
import httpx

client = httpx.Client(http2=True)
response = client.get("https://http2.github.io/")
print(response)
```

Note that HTTP/2 support requires additional installation:

```bash
pip install httpx[http2]
```

HTTPX also provides excellent streaming support for handling large responses efficiently:

```python
with httpx.stream("GET", "https://httpbin.org/stream/10") as resp:
   for text in resp.iter_text():
       print(text)
```

While HTTPX doesn't include built-in caching, you can integrate [Hishel](https://hishel.com/).

Unlike Requests, HTTPX doesn't follow redirects by default but can be configured to do so:

```python
import httpx

# test http --> https redirect
response = httpx.get('http://github.com/', follow_redirects=True)
```

Despite its asynchronous features adding some complexity, HTTPX provides simple methods for both synchronous and asynchronous requests. Its popularity continues to grow, supported by [comprehensive documentation](https://www.python-httpx.org/) and an active community.

HTTPX is ideal for projects requiring a feature-rich HTTP client with asynchronous capabilities.

### aiohttp

[aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/) focuses exclusively on asynchronous programming, excelling in high-performance web scraping scenarios requiring concurrent, non-blocking requests.

Here's how to use aiohttp for concurrent scraping:

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def fetch_data(url):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(url) as response:
            return await response.text()    

async def demo_aiohttp():
    print("Testing `aiohttp` library...")
    urls = [
        'https://www.python.org/',
        'http://httpbin.org/get',
        'http://httpbin.org/ip',
    ]
    tasks = [fetch_data(url) for url in urls]
    responses = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    for resp_text in responses:
        print(f"Response: {resp_text}")

# async entry point to execute the code      
asyncio.run(demo_aiohttp())
```

This code creates an asynchronous function `fetch_data()` that establishes a session and sends a GET request. The `demo_aiohttp()` function creates tasks for multiple URLs and executes them concurrently using `asyncio.gather()`.

aiohttp handles HTTP redirects automatically and supports streaming responses for efficient memory management when processing large files. It also offers a wide range of third-party middleware and extensions.

Additionally, aiohttp can function as a [development server](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/#server-example), though this article focuses on its client capabilities.

The library lacks HTTP/2 support and built-in caching, though you can add caching with libraries like [aiohttp-client-cache](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp-client-cache/).

aiohttp's asynchronous nature makes it more complex than simpler clients like Requests, requiring a solid understanding of asynchronous programming. However, it's quite popular with 14.7K GitHub stars and numerous [third-party extensions](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/third_party.html#aiohttp-3rd-party). It also provides comprehensive [documentation](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/index.html).

Choose aiohttp for real-time data scraping tasks like monitoring stock prices or tracking live events.
